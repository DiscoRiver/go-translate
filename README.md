# go-translate
A multi-threaded translator using the Google API

# Setup
Since the Google API for translation isn't free, the only additional thing you'll need is a Google credentials file, added as an environment variable like;

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path>/google-creds.json"
```
